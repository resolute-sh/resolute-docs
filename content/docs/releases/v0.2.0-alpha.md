# v0.2.0-alpha

Released: February 2026

Windowed processing, automatic scheduling, and production deployment features.

## New Features

### Windowed/Batched Processing

Nodes in parallel steps can now process data in batches instead of fetching everything at once. The framework loops: fetch batch, run downstream pipeline, persist cursors, repeat.

```go
jira.FetchIssues(input).
    WithWindow(core.Window{Size: 100}).
    WithCursorUpdate("jira", "LastUpdated")
```

New APIs:

| API | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| `WithWindow(Window)` | Attach to a fetch node to enable batched processing |
| `Window{Size: N}` | Configure batch size |
| `WindowOutput()` | DataRef marker that resolves to the current batch's output |
| `WindowConfig()` | Returns the node's window configuration |
| `WindowedNode` interface | Extends `ExecutableNode` for windowed execution |
| `FlowState.NewBatchState()` | Creates isolated state per batch, inheriting parent cursors |
| `FlowState.SetWindowMeta()` / `GetWindowMeta()` | Ephemeral cursor and size tracking per batch |

### Cursor-Based Incremental Sync

Nodes can now automatically update cursors from their output after execution.

```go
node := jira.FetchIssues(input).
    WithCursorUpdate("jira", "LastUpdated")
```

The named field is extracted from the activity output and persisted as the cursor position. Supports `time.Time`, `*time.Time`, and `string` field types.

### Automatic Temporal Schedule Management

Workers with `core.Schedule(...)` triggered flows now automatically create or update Temporal Schedules on startup.

- Idempotent: creates on first run, updates cron expression on subsequent runs
- Overlap policy set to `SKIP` (no concurrent executions)
- Schedule ID derived from flow name: `<flow-name>-schedule`

```go
flow := core.NewFlow("data-sync").
    TriggeredBy(core.Schedule("*/30 * * * *")).
    // ...
    Build()

// Worker automatically creates/updates the "data-sync-schedule" Temporal Schedule
core.NewWorker().
    WithFlow(flow).
    Run()
```

### Input Validation

Nodes can validate input structs using struct tags before execution.

```go
type Input struct {
    Name string `validate:"required"`
    Age  int    `validate:"min=0,max=150"`
}

node := core.NewNode("validate", myActivity, input).WithValidation()
```

### Error Classification

Nodes can classify errors for Temporal retry decisions. Terminal errors are marked as non-retryable.

```go
node := jira.FetchIssues(input).WithErrorClassifier(core.HTTPErrorClassifier)
```

## Improvements

### Parallel Execution Rewrite

Replaced Temporal `Selector`-based parallel execution with `workflow.Go` + `BufferedChannel` pattern.

- Proper per-node error attribution (error messages now include the failing node name and input)
- Compensation snapshots taken before parallel execution for correct rollback state

### State Management

- Added `inMemoryBackend` as default when no state backend is configured
- `mergeCursors()` correctly updates parent cursors from batch state, keeping the chronologically later position

### Workflow Registration

Workflows are now registered with explicit names via `RegisterWorkflowWithOptions`, enabling schedule and trigger references by flow name.

### Makefile

- Added `test-flows` target for testing flow modules
- All targets (`lint`, `fmt`, `build`, `verify`, `update-deps`, `vet`) now include `../flows/*` modules

## Dependencies

- `go.temporal.io/api` promoted from indirect to direct dependency (required for schedule overlap policy)

## Installation

```bash
go get github.com/resolute-sh/resolute@v0.2.0-alpha
```

## Migration from v0.1.0-alpha

No breaking changes to existing APIs. All new features are additive:

- `WithWindow`, `WithCursorUpdate`, `WithValidation`, `WithErrorClassifier` are optional node modifiers
- Automatic schedule creation only activates when a flow uses `core.Schedule(...)` trigger
- Parallel execution behavior is unchanged from the caller's perspective (internal implementation improved)
